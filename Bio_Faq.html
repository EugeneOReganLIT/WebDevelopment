 <h1> Purpose of site and author</h1>

        <figure class = "left">

    <p>Hi and welcome. My name is Eugene O' Regan. I have taught <em>Java</em> in various roles over the past 5 years. I have worked as an in-class instructor and an online teacher, delivering courses primarily aimed at beginners. I have also taught other ICT based topics (<em>C/C++, Operating Systems, DSS, DBMS, ECDL/MOS </em>) and I am extremely passionate about the effective delivery of education methods. It is this experience that has lead me to the idea of creating this site, as the first tentative step in the process of assisting others (and myself) learn the skills to become better programmers.</p>
      <h2>Why this site?</h2>
        <p>This site was developed to assist beginner Java programmers in  dealing with the difficulties associated with the complex topics encountered when starting Java programming. These learners would include 3rd level students, jobseekers on retraining programs or, in a very recent development, Coder Dojo students. <br>I feel that the complexities of Java can get in the way of basic problem solving and ultimately lead to potential programmers deciding not to continue in their pursuit. Thus, if there was a way to show this group methods to break down the requirements given to them and to rebuild them in the form of working code, they may wish to stay. I am hoping that this site is a positive step in addressing this issue.</p> 
      <h2>How the site is structured</h2>
        <p>The site has been sectioned into various segments, which are </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="Basic_Java_Topics.html"><em>Topics</em></a> – A listing of topics relevant to the beginner programmer, including .ppt/.pdf and video links (provided from Eugene’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2rAlrOdSajiNm_sUIUXCzA"   target= "_blank">YouTube</a> channel). </li>
                <li><a href="General_Algorithm_Tips.html"><em>General Tips</em></a> – A list of tips for general approach to problem solving generated from suggestions from other domains, emphasising the need for this skill in everyday life.</li>
                <li><a href="Java_Algorithm_Tips.html"><em>Java Specific Tips</em></a> – A list of tips based on Java and IDE specific topics. There's also a compilation of good habits to acquire, bad habits to get rid of in a <a href="Java_Algorithm_Tips.html#dosDonts">Do's and Don'ts</a> section</li>
                <li><a href="ChopShop.html"><em>The Chop Shop</em></a> – A page with two sections. See the section below to find out more.</li>
                <li><a href="ResourcesLinks.html"> <em>Resources and Links</em></a> – Websites and equipment experienced programmers have used to write code and improve their knowledge and ability.</li>
                <li><a href="Contact_Form.html"><em>Contact Form</em></a>- A contact form which allows the reader to send in questions, suggestions and other correspondence.</li>
            </ol> 
      <h3>The Chop Shop</h3> <p>This section is to serve as a storage point for small snippets of code, but also to test this knowledg. But remember - it ain't a test and the instant it becomes a chore, throw it out the gap.</p>
      <ol type="1">
                        <li><a href = "/ChopShop.html#toolKit">The Tool Kit</a> - Like any skill, coding is reliant on knowing certain common algorithms / procedures and as you become more familiar with these, your skill level will advance. This section is to demonstrate how to incrementally build up code and also the importance of external knowledge. I will place small snippets of code on a regular basis for beginners. There will be video tutorials on the more important pieces of code.</li>
                        <li><a href = "/ChopShop.html#panucciChopShopChallenge">The Panucci Chop Shop Challenge</a> - This, as the name suggests, is a set of challenges for the beginner and more experienced programmers. There will be a new set each month and solutions will be provided (my own and the best from those submitted). </li>
                    </ol>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>The site's current content was generated from feedback from programming and non-programming educational professionals. However, it is hoped as more material and tips are made available that the direction, amount and scope of content will evolve. What areas would be considered?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A plain speaking non-technical glossary.</li>
            <li>More areas covered, such as <em>Oracle Certification</em> and <em>Aptitude testing</em>.</li>
            <li>Areas suggested by <strong>YOU</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This plan will take time and effort. However, I am hoping that as people find some benefit of the site that the community developing it (or off-shot sites) will grow to assist in the process. </p>
    <h2>Your role - Feedback and assistance</h2>
      <p>Feedback, good and bad (but in a <em>constructive</em>  manner) is essential for any development. We hope that content and ideas for content will be generated by the users over time. The plan is to share the credit for this process and to grow as a group. If you wish to obtain help or assistance, contact me via the site <a href = "Contact_Form.html">Contact</a> page or directly via <a href="mailto:slaineoregan@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
    <h2>What is the meaning of <strong>"An Coder Nua"</strong>?</h2>
      <p>An Coder Nua is Gaelic for "The New Coder". I wanted something succint and meaningful, whilst still reflecting my own origins.</p>
    <h2> So why all the nature photos? And the quotes?</h2>
      <p>Besides looking at the odd bit of Java, there are other things that keep me occupied. Mountain biking, hiking and <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/eugiepanucci1974/">photography</a> are perhaps my favourite hobbies. So what has this to do with Java? Well, in my opinion, they are extremely similar - all involve a lot of effort and they demand some level of planning. However, most importantly they all involve hitting and breaking through<strong>"The Wall"</strong> and really enjoying the experience beyond that point. And besides, a site 100% full of code content would be a bit boring anyways. </p>
      <p>As for the quotes - well, they are where I get some inspiration from various artists and writers. Music helps to get you through the slow days of stagnation, fires you up on the good days and most importantly, helps to switch off when you aren't programming. And while music is a deeply subjective choice, we might compile the ultimate programmer's playlist. </p>
