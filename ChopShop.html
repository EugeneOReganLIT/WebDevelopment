            <p>Like any skilled professional (or dedicated hobbyist), there's always the need to have small examples of previous work at hand to assist in future projects. This could be in the form of notes, sketches, labelled prototypes or in the case of the programmer, a store of carefully commented snippets of code. This code will be short but very focused and commented (which may be removed in the commercial release of the code).</p>
            <p>Accordingly, I will be providing sample code that will be developed in an incremental manner. This will be done to demonstrate the importance of disciplined programming and keeping things simple. Time permitting, I will also provide videos of the more important examples and will work on the more popular requested code.</p>

    <h1 id = "panucciChopShopChallenge">The Panucci Chop Shop Challenge </h1>
        <p>Like playing the guitar, unless you're practising coding frequently, your skills won't evolve. So, with that in mind, whether you're stuck on basic strings or fancy yourself as the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKhPCjQZONk" target="_blank">Rory Gallagher</a> of recusion, there should be something below to get you rocking.</p>
        <h2>Challenge No.1 - November 2017</h2>
            <p> The challenges below will involve the following components, so get reading those books, scanning websites and terrorising the forums. I'll throw out a few hints from time to time, if people are stuck. The main aim is that you work out the algorithm rather than the code. But most of all, have a bit of fun whilst doing them. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arithmetic </li>
                    <li>Loops </li>
                    <li>Parsing </li>
                    <li> Arrays </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Assume all input is numeric and positive for now. Obviously if you can develop them, do!</p>
        <h2>Absolute Beginners - Opening Chords </h2>
            <p> Write a program that will take in two numbers from the screen as input, add them and output the result. </p>
            <p>Improve the program by allowing the user to continue this process (entering 2 numbers and seeing the result on screen):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A set number of times, defined at the start of the program (either hard coded or entered by the user).</li>
                    <li>Until the user inputs a specific number or character e.g. a negative number.</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Stuck in the Middle with you – Barre Chord Bridge </h2>
                <p> Write a program that will take in a number that has more than one digit i.e. a number greater than 10. The program will then add up the sum of the individual digits of that number. For example, if the user enters 37, the program will perform 3 + 7, giving a total of 10. Keep the numbers whole and positive for now.</p>
        <h2>Master of Puppets – Knuckle Bustin’ Closer </h2>
                <p>Write a program that will take in a number from screen. Without the use of either divisor operands, determine if the number is divisible by 9. It is possible and relies on a mathematical property of the number 9. </p>

          <h2>Submitting the code</h2>
            <input id ="submitCSCbtn" type="button" value="Submit Code" onclick="window.location.href='Contact_Form.html'" /> 
            <p>Submit the code in a Word or text document (It would be a nightmare dealing with all the .jar files). As I said before, any good or indeed, unique solutions will be put up on the site for all to see. To submit your solution via the contact page, click <a href="Contact_Form.html">here</a> or on the <em>Submit Code</em> icon to the right (making sure that you select the correct option from the <em>Reason for Contacting ...</em> menu). If neither link works, <a href="emailto:slaineoregan@gmail.com">email</a> the document to me. Good luck and remember ... have fun.
