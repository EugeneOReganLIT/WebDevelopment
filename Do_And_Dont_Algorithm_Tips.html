      <h1> Do's and Don'ts</h1>
      
 <h2>Do's</h2>     
<ol>
<li>Work with values you know – Start off with values that will produce known results. Then, as you confirm that your code can deal with the simpler cases, integrate functionality to deal with more difficult cases</li>
<li>Break problems down to their most basic of components. A computer must take baby steps and while humans can subconsciously do very complex tasks e.g. arithmetic, these steps must be simplified further in the programming steps. Work out what a human would do (in English) to solve this problem and examine what steps you took</li>
<li>Draw diagrams to represent code scenarios – As well as solving problems, they should also clear up any assumptions and verify the various states of data</li>
<li>After breaking down the problem to its most basic of steps, build it back up again slowly. Verify that the smaller components compile and then build on that.</li>
<li>Think of cases that will break your code e.g. pass null value</li>
<li>If you can’t find the issue, talk yourself through it – rubber duck debugging</li>
</ol>  <img class = "right" src ="img/Bull.JPG" width = 180 height = 150 alt = "Beware of the Bull" />    

<h2>Don'ts</h2>   
      
    
      <ol>
<li>Don’t write all your code before compiling the code for the first time - Finding logical errors will be more difficult if there is too much of your intended algorithm in place by then</li>
<li>Think that your code will run correctly even if it compiles – it may run but chances are, will need fine tuning</li> 
         
<li>Don’t overengineer just because you read some difficult scenario online – it will come with time to find better ways to solve some problems.</li>
<li>Don’t start your problem solving at the computer without some notion of a plan</li>
</ol>
