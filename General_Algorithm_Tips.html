     <h1>General Tips</h1>
        <p>The following series of points (compiled from points reviewed by several IT and non-IT friends). The points really emphaise the fact that programming is like any other task - if you wish to become adept, you must somehow </p>
         <ol>
            <li><em>Practise, practise, practise</em> – it is the most effective means of learning. The thinking is worse than the doing, so if  feeling unmotivated, just try to do five minutes of writing one line of code. </li>

                    <li><em>Share information</em> – If you find something useful, share it with colleagues.</li>
                    <li><em>Know your strengths and weaknesses</em> - If in a class, you may be strong in other areas than programming. Identify people strong in programming and offer to help them in areas other than programming as you become more adept at coding.</li>
                    <li><em>Do not be afraid</em> - Don't be afraid to ask for help and advice. Everyone had to start at some point and had to ask questions.</li>
   
            </ol>
<h2>No matter what the topic being studied, always be clear of</h2>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li><em>Why</em> you are learning a specific component of the topic.</li>
            <li><em>What</em> is the basic functionality of that component.</li>
            <li><em>Where</em> to find information on the component quickly.</li>
            <li><em>How</em> this component interacts with other related components.</li>
        </ol>
     
     <h2>Above all, help each other and do so in a manner of mutual respect</h2>
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Learners – Try to provide as much specific information when asking for help or advice. And remember, At some stage you will become an expert. Remember the help you received along that journey and reciprocate that to new learners.</li>
                    <li>Teachers / Forum members – If the information is missing from the learner’s initial request, inform him/her in a cordial fashion. And remember the respect that was shown to you when you were learning</li>
