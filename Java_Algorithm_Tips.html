      <h1> Java Tips</h1>
      <p> The following is a list of specific Java tips, relating to code and practises. Links are available for some of the the more important topics and more will be provided in time. The more relevant point is that this list is not finite and is dependent on people contributing, so please feel free to comment, elaborate or suggest other tips. You can reach us via our <a href = "Contact_Form.html">Contact</a> page or via <a href = "mailto:slaineoregan@gmail.com"> email</a>. </p>
 
      <h2>Java Specific Tips</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Know the interaction between the various components and their individual elements e.g. the parameters of a for loop</li>
            <li>Experiment with code – Don’t wait for assignments to test your understanding of code. Use your initiative</li>
            <li>Store code effectively – You will need to be able to find reliable working code quickly, so the use of measures, such as proper naming and versioniong, is vital.</li>
            <li>Get into good practises early: This would include knowing the main programming conventions (naming, use of comments, etc.), the proper use of indentation and proper member names.</li>
            <li>Keep your code simple for now. If that means more lines of code but understandable code, so be it. Code should be sectionalised into atomic, functional units i.e. each part does one thing and does it well. Once you get up to speed with different frameworks and advanced functionality, you can write the complex code, but for now, short and to the </li>
            <li>Know the interaction between the various components and their individual elements e.g. the parameters of a for loop.</li>
            <li>Terminology – Get to know Java specific terms. Having a <a  href= "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/glossary-135216.html">glossary</a> is beneficial for any new programmer. You may not understand the terms initially, but will in time. </li>
            <li>Error messages and <a href = " https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_exceptions.htm">exceptions </a> – Know the reasons behind common exceptions. One of the quickest and effective means of doing this is provoking them. </li>
            <li>Know your <a href = "http://www.codejava.net/ides" target = "_blank">IDEs</a> (NetBeans / Eclipse being the most popular. Know their shortcuts, tools such as debugging and refactroing and the automated functionality of each.</li>
            </ol>

 
      <h2 id ="dosDonts"> Do's and Don'ts</h2>
            <figure class = "right">

        <h2>Do's</h2>     
            <ol>

                <li>Work with values you know – Start off with values that will produce known results. Then, as you confirm that your code can deal with the simpler cases, integrate functionality to deal with more difficult cases</li>
            
                <li>Break problems down to their most basic of components. A computer must take baby steps and while humans can subconsciously do very complex tasks e.g. arithmetic, these steps must be simplified further in the programming steps. Work out what a human would do (in English) to solve this problem and examine what steps you took</li>
                <li>Draw diagrams to represent code scenarios – As well as solving problems, they should also clear up any assumptions and verify the various states of data</li>                                     
                     
                <li>After breaking down the problem to its most basic of steps, build it back up again slowly. Verify that the smaller components compile and then build on that.</li>
                <li>Think of cases that will break your code e.g. pass null value into methods.</li>
                <li>If you can’t find the issue, talk yourself through it – rubber duck debugging.</li>
                <li>Groups and group programming - Use concepts such as Peer Reviews, Paired Programming and web-based sharing platforms, such as GitHub to get into effective collaborative programming</li>
            </ol>

      <h2>Don'ts</h2>   
 
    
        <ol>
            <li>Don’t write all your code before compiling the code for the first time - Finding logical errors will be more difficult if there is too much of your intended algorithm in place by then</li>
            <li>Don't think that your code will run correctly even if it compiles – it may run but chances are, it will need fine tuning to run as functionally intended. </li> 
            <li>Don’t overengineer your code just because you read/saw some difficult scenario being solved intricately – This ability will come with time.</li>
            <li>Don’t start your problem solving at the computer without some notion of a plan - Even if it's only on the back of an envelope, write out the barest of plans.</li>
        </ol>
