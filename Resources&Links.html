      <h2>Equipment </h2>
      <ul class = "cprompt">
        <li> <strong>A4 sketchpads</strong>  - Good for rough work and diagrams. <br></li><li><strong>Whiteboards </strong>- While maybe seen as overkill, a whiteboard can be very helpful for group discussions and working out problems initially. </li>
        <li><strong>A4 foolscap paper</strong> - To write down and refine the rough code.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-coloured pens </strong>- To denote different elements in the code e.g. comments, method calls, etc. </li>
          
      </ul>
      <h2> Books</h2>
      <p>It is always beneficial to have a physical book nearby when programming. As well as being easier to read than several webpages, you can mark pages for quick reference. Nowadays, most of these books are downloadable in .pdf format, making storage and reading easier.
      <br>
        It is important to note that while there are 9 iterations of Java, there is  a <strong>strong compulstion to get the most recent texts.</strong> Books covering previous versions of Java will be sufficient for any beginner / intermediate programmer.
