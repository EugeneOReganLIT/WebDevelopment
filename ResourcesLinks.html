 <h1>Resources and Links</h1>
      <p>This page has various resources and links that have made many of the contributors' coding experience easier. It will be added to over time and if you would like to add or comment on any of the content, please get in touch via our <a href = "Contact_Form.html">Contact Us</a> page or send an email to my <a href = "mailto:slaineoregan@gmail.com">  email </a>account.</p>
      
      <h2>Useful Equipment </h2>
      <p> The following is a list of non-computer related equipment that has proven to be helpful in the initial composition of code. The list is confirmation that time away from the computer and compiler is necessary in order to properly ascertain all details of the presented scenario. </p>
      <ul class = "cprompt">
            <li> <strong>A4 sketchpads</strong>  - Good for rough work and diagrams.</li>
            <li><strong>Whiteboards </strong>- While maybe seen as overkill, a whiteboard can be very helpful for group discussions and working out problems initially. </li>
            <li><strong>A4 foolscap paper</strong> - To write down and refine the rough code.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-coloured pens </strong>- To denote different elements in the code e.g. comments, method calls, etc. </li>
            <li><strong>Snipping Tool / PrintScreen </strong>- Good for compiling notes in a classroom environment or when being shown how to do a task in a compiler.</li> 
            <li><strong>Mobile Phone</strong>- To take pictures of code on a whiteboard or to double as a dictaphone. </li>         
      </ul>
      <h2> Books</h2>
        <p>It is always beneficial to have a book at hand when programming. As well as being easier to read than webpages, you can mark sections for quick reference. 
        </p>
      <h2>Getting the latest versions of the books ... is it needed?</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to note that as there are 9 revisions of Java, there maybe a strong compulsion to get the most recently published books in order to be up to date. <em>This is totally unecessary</em>. Books covering previous versions of Java will be sufficient for any beginner / intermediate programmer. So with that in mind, here is a list of good publications:

            <figcaption class = "right"><em>OCA SE 8 I Guide <br></em></figcaption>    
        </figure>          
      <ul class = "cprompt">
            <li><span class="bookTitle">Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies, 3rd Edition,</span><em>Burd, B.A.</em> - Another in the popular series of books aimed particularly at beginners.</li>
           <li><span class="bookTitle">OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Guide 1st Edition, </span><em> Gupta, M.</em> - Although written for the OCA exams, Gupta covers the subjects expertly and in an accessible manner. An excellent author.</li>
           <li><span class="bookTitle">Java in 21 Days, Sams Teach Yourself (Covering Java 9) (8th Edition)  </span><em> Cadenhead, R.</em> - A good reference text, in it's 8th guise. It is well organised, with distinct sections and clear path of progression.</li>           
     </ul>
